# Personal Notes
So, I've added the angular files by using the "ng" command. 
then I've tried to git add . them using the terminal, then push, then git commit.
But I don't see the new folders on the github site

## Second note
Okay, it looks like the angular files have been added. It might have taken a while for it to reflect on the site.
